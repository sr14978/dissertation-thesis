This is the readme file to describe where to obtain auxiliary content to supplement the dissertation of Samuel Russell, entitled  -- Innocuous Ciphertexts: The DE-CENSOR Scheme.

The thesis can be accessed at https://github.com/sr14978/dissertation-thesis/releases/download/1.1/dte.pdf

As the thesis explains, I have produced a detection scheme and an encryption scheme to bypass the detection. 

The core of the code that implements these features as well as some example traffic, is hosted in a public git repository at https://github.com/sr14978/innocuous_ciphertexts.

Furthermore, to show an example of the DE-CENSOR scheme in action, the original FTE proxy system has been adapted to incorporate the new cryptographic primitive. The code for this is again hosted in a public git repository at https://github.com/sr14978/ICproxy.
